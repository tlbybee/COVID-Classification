## Project Idea

COVID X-ray image classification is an important task for radiology. In the recent years, there have been Xray image datasets released for training machine learning models. It has been shown that COVID-19 can be detected from X-ray images. Chest X-rays are the first choice in terms of the initial imaging test when caring for
patients with suspected COVID-19. Thus COVID-19 diagnostic plays an important role in clinical workflows for helping clinicians perform more important tasks. In this task, the goal is to develop models for automatic COVID19 detection using chest X-ray images. The trained model developed should be able to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs.Pneumonia) settings. 

### Data Sets

- COVID-Chest-xray-dataset: This dataset contains 542 frontal chest X-ray images from 262 people from 26 countries. This also contains clinical attributes about survival, ICU stay, intubation events, blood tests, location, as well as freeform clinical notes for each image/case. This dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/ieee8023/

- Curated COVID-19 dataset: This dataset contains COVID-19, no-findings and pneumonia images. This dataset is combination of the data from multiple sources. This contains 127 COVID-19 images collected from COVID-Chest-xray-dataset and Normal and pneumonia images are collected from ChestX-ray8 database.
